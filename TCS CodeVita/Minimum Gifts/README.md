Explanation

For testcase 1, adhering to rules mentioned above,

Employee # 1 whose rank is 1 gets one gift
Employee # 2 whose rank is 2 gets two gifts
Employee # 3 whose rank is 1 gets one gift
Employee # 4 whose rank is 5 gets two gifts
Employee # 5 whose rank is 2 gets one gift
Therefore, total gifts required is 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7

Employee # 1 whose rank is 1 gets one gift
Employee # 2 whose rank is 2 gets two gifts
Therefore, total gifts required is 1 + 2 = 3
